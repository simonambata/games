RandomLink (Simon says) Rules:
1. first pokemon catch on every route
2. level cap and no sub out in storage box
3. for every death, swap out randomly in draft picks via randomizer.py
4. the lower the death count the better
5. no use of items in battle
6. no duplicate held items

Optional Rules:
Less Six Clause - if your total pokemon is less than or equal to six, you retain your pokemon but your death score is still counted
Pokemon League Clause - once a pokemon dies in the Elite Four, you may revive them by using your stocked up revives
Revive Clause - you cannot buy revives, but you can use picked-up revives to retain a pokemon in your party (still cannot use in-battle revives)
Revive Together Clause - you can pool your revives with your teammate to have a shared number of revives (sum up your revives and buy enough to match your pooled number of revives)
Dupes Complex Clause - you may attempt to catch a new pokemon in a new route if you have already caught the encountered pokemon
